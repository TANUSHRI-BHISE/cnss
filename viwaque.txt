Q: What is the difference between link-state and distance-vector routing?
A: DV routers exchange whole routing vectors with neighbors (hop counts/costs). LS routers flood link-state advertisements (LSAs) to the entire network and each router computes shortest paths (Dijkstra) from full topology.

Q: Which algorithms implement DV and LS?
A: DV typically uses Bellman-Ford style updates; LS uses Dijkstra’s shortest path first (SPF) algorithm.

Q: What data does each router maintain?
A: DV: routing table with destination, next-hop, cost; LS: link-state database (graph of network), and computed routing table after SPF.

Q: What is a routing table entry?
A: Destination, cost (metric), next hop (and sometimes interface, expiry/timer).


1. Basic understanding

Q: What is a Link State Routing Protocol?
A: A routing protocol where each router has complete knowledge of the network topology and computes the shortest path to every node (e.g., using Dijkstra’s algorithm).

Q: What is the difference between Link State and Distance Vector protocols?
A:

Feature	Link State	Distance Vector
Knowledge	Complete topology	Only neighbors’ info
Algorithm	Dijkstra	Bellman-Ford
Convergence	Fast	Slower
Updates	Triggered	Periodic

Q: Which protocol did you implement and why?
A: Implemented Link State using Dijkstra because it finds the shortest path based on complete topology information.

2. Algorithm-specific

Q: How does Dijkstra’s algorithm work?
A:

Initialize distances: source node = 0, others = ∞

Pick the unvisited node with the smallest distance.

Update distances to its neighbors if a shorter path is found.

Repeat until all nodes are visited.

Q: How do you represent the network in your program?
A: Using an adjacency matrix or adjacency list with weights representing link cost.

Q: How do you handle unreachable nodes?
A: Distance remains ∞, and the path is considered unreachable.

3. Program-related

Q: What data structures did you use?
A: Arrays for distances, a set for visited nodes, and optionally a priority queue for efficiency.

Q: How did you print the shortest path?
A: Using a parent array that stores the previous node for each node, then trace back from destination to source.

Q: How do you update the routing table?
A: After Dijkstra finishes, the next-hop for each destination is derived from the path found.

4. Testing & Output

Q: How did you verify your program?
A: By comparing shortest paths manually or with sample network graphs.

Q: Can this program handle dynamic changes (link failure)?
A: Yes, by updating the adjacency matrix and rerunning Dijkstra.

5. Advanced questions

Q: What is the time complexity of your program?
A:

Using adjacency matrix: O(V²)

Using adjacency list + min-priority queue: O(E log V)

Q: Why is Link State preferred in large networks?
A: Fast convergence and accurate routing due to complete topology knowledge.

Q: Difference between static routing and dynamic routing?
A: Static is manually configured; dynamic adapts automatically to network changes.

Q: How did you implement file transfer?
A:

Open the file in read-binary mode at sender.

Read in chunks and send via socket.send().

Receive chunks at receiver via socket.recv() and write to file.

Q: How did you handle end-of-file or completion of transfer?
A: Either send a special termination message or check when no more bytes are received.

Q: What ports did you use?
A: Any free port >1024 (e.g., 5000, 6000), because ports <1024 are reserved.

3. Network and connection questions

Q: How do client and server connect?
A: Server binds to an IP and port → listens → client connects using server’s IP and port → handshake completes → data transfer.

Q: How does TCP ensure reliable delivery?
A: By using ACKs, sequence numbers, retransmissions, and flow control.

Q: What happens if the connection is lost during file transfer?
A: TCP automatically retransmits lost packets, but partial files may need manual restart or resuming mechanism in the program.

4. Programming and coding questions

Q: What libraries did you use?
A: In Python: socket, optionally os for file operations.
In C/C++: <sys/socket.h>, <netinet/in.h>, <arpa/inet.h>, <unistd.h>.
