Step-by-Step: Capture SSL Traffic and Find IP
Step 1: Open Wireshark

Launch Wireshark on your PC.

Select the network interface your computer is using (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).

Step 2: Start Capturing

Click the green shark-fin button to start capture.

Don’t worry about other traffic; we will filter later.

Step 3: Open a Single HTTPS Website

Open your browser.

Type the website domain (HTTPS only, e.g., github.com) and press Enter.

Do not open multiple websites at the same time to avoid confusion.

Wait until the website fully loads.

Step 4: Stop Capturing

Go back to Wireshark.

Click the red square button to stop the capture.

Step 5: Filter TLS/SSL Traffic

In Wireshark Display Filter, type:
-----------
tls||ssl
tls
----------

or

tcp.port == 443


This shows only HTTPS (SSL/TLS) traffic.

Step 6: Find the Server IP

Method A: From TLS Handshake Packet

Look for packets labeled Client Hello, Server Hello, or Certificate in the Info column.

Click the packet → expand Internet Protocol (IP) layer → check Destination field.

This is the website’s IP address.

Method B: Using CMD Ping

Open Command Prompt (Win + R → cmd).

Type the domain of the website:
---------------------
ping github.com

---------------------------
Press Enter → Output shows:

Pinging github.com [140.82.113.3] ...


The IP in brackets [140.82.113.3] is the server IP.

✅ This IP should match the destination IP in Wireshark.

Step 7 (Optional): Confirm Traffic Belongs to the Site

In Wireshark, you can filter by this IP:

ip.addr == 140.82.113.3


This ensures only traffic to/from GitHub is visible.

Step 8 (Optional for Viva)

Explain: “TLS packets captured include Client Hello, Server Hello, and Certificate.

The server IP was confirmed using both Wireshark and ping.”

Summary for Viva

Open Wireshark → select interface → start capture.

Open one HTTPS website.

Stop capture → filter with tls or tcp.port==443.

Identify destination IP from TLS handshake.

Ping the website in CMD → confirm IP matches Wireshark.
