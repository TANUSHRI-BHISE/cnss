🌐 The Main Idea of Your Practical

The problem says:

“Write a program using TCP socket for wired network to:
(A) Say Hello to each other
(B) Transfer a file.”

That means you must:

Make two computers talk to each other (Hello! 👋).

Then send a file from one computer to the other.

🧩 Step 1: What Is TCP?

TCP = Transmission Control Protocol
It’s the same system used when you open websites, send emails, or watch YouTube.

It ensures:

Data goes in correct order

No part is lost or damaged

Connection is reliable

Think of TCP as a safe courier service — it won’t lose your parcel (data).

🧠 Step 2: What Is a Socket?

A socket is like a door in your computer through which data can enter or leave.

When two computers talk using TCP:

One computer opens a door and waits (Server)

Another computer knocks and connects (Client)

So you have:

Server socket → waits for connections

Client socket → connects to the server

💬 Step 3: Saying “Hello” to Each Other
1️⃣ Server (PC-2)

Opens a door (for example, Port 5000)

Waits for someone to connect

2️⃣ Client (PC-1)

Finds the server’s IP (e.g., 192.168.1.6)

Connects to that door (Port 5000)

Says “Hello from Client!”

Server replies “Hello from Server!”

✅ That’s part A — “Say Hello to Each Other”.

📁 Step 4: File Transfer

After saying Hello, the Client now sends a file.

Example:

Client reads a file (like sample.txt)

Breaks it into chunks (small pieces of bytes)

Sends each chunk through the TCP connection

Server receives those chunks and saves them as a new file (received_file.txt)

✅ That’s part B — “File Transfer”.

⚙️ Step 5: The Program in Action (Behind the Scenes)

Here’s what happens technically:

Step	Action	                Who Does It	                Example
1	Create TCP socket	Both	                    Like creating a phone line
2	Bind to port (5000)	Server	                    Like connecting the line
3	Listen for connections	Server	                       Waiting for a call
4	Connect to server	Client	                        Dialing the number
5	Exchange Hello	Both	Talking
6	Send file	Client → Server	Sending parcel
7	Save file	Server	Parcel received
🧠 Step 6: Why We Use Two Python Files
File	Role	Runs on
server.py	Waits for connections and receives file	PC-2
client.py	Connects to server and sends file	PC-1

They both use Python’s socket library, which provides ready-made tools for TCP communication.

💡 Step 7: What “Wired Network” Means

It means your two PCs are connected through a LAN cable or same Wi-Fi network.
That way, they share the same IP range (like 192.168.1.x) and can talk directly.

🏁 Step 8: What You’re Proving

This experiment shows that:

You understand how TCP connections are created

You can exchange messages reliably

You can send files between computers using Python sockets

In short, it’s like building your own mini WhatsApp for file sharing 😄
--------------------------------------------------
⚙️ Step-by-Step Explanation (Server Side)
🧱 Step 1 — Import the socket library
import socket


This gives Python access to all the tools needed for network communication using TCP.

🖥️ Step 2 — Define IP and Port
host = '127.0.0.1'  # For testing on same PC, or server's LAN IP
port = 12345


'127.0.0.1' → special IP meaning “this computer itself” (localhost).

You can replace this with another computer’s IP (like 192.168.1.6) if you want to connect from another PC.

12345 is just a random port number — like choosing a door number.

🔌 Step 3 — Create a TCP Socket
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)


AF_INET → IPv4 address type

SOCK_STREAM → TCP connection type (reliable, ordered communication)

🪟 Step 4 — Bind and Listen
server_socket.bind((host, port))
server_socket.listen(1)
print("Server listening...")


bind() attaches the socket to the IP and port.

listen(1) means “start listening for 1 client.”

It now waits for someone to connect.

📞 Step 5 — Accept Client Connection
conn, addr = server_socket.accept()
print(f"Connected by {addr}")


The server pauses here and waits for a client to connect.

When someone does, it prints their IP and port.

Example:

Connected by ('127.0.0.1', 50532)

💬 Step 6 — Receive “Hello” Message
msg = conn.recv(1024).decode('ascii')
print("Client says:", msg)


recv(1024) → receives up to 1024 bytes of data from the client.

.decode('ascii') → converts the bytes into readable text.

💬 Step 7 — Send Reply to Client
conn.send("Hello from Server!".encode('ascii'))


The server replies back to the client with a hello message.

📁 Step 8 — Receive Filename
filename = conn.recv(1024).decode('ascii')


The client sends the name of the file it’s about to transfer (e.g., "sample.txt").

The server stores that name to save the file with a new name (received_sample.txt).

📂 Step 9 — Receive File Data
with open("received_" + filename, "wb") as f:
    while True:
        data = conn.recv(1024)
        if not data:
            break
        f.write(data)


Opens a new file in binary write mode (wb).

Receives data from the client in chunks of 1024 bytes.

Keeps writing until there’s no more data (i.e., client closed the connection).

✅ Step 10 — Finish and Close
print(f"File '{filename}' received successfully.")
conn.close()


Closes the connection after file transfer is done.
---------------------------------------------------------
Step-by-Step Explanation (Client Side)
🧱 Step 1 — Import socket
import socket


This lets Python use networking (TCP/IP communication).

🖥️ Step 2 — Define Server IP and Port
host = '127.0.0.1'  # Server IP
port = 12345


This must match the server’s IP and port.

If both programs (client and server) run on the same PC, 127.0.0.1 is fine.

If you run the client from another PC on your LAN, replace 127.0.0.1 with the server’s IP address, e.g., 192.168.1.6.

🔌 Step 3 — Create Socket and Connect
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client_socket.connect((host, port))


socket() creates the TCP socket.

connect() establishes a connection to the server that’s waiting on port 12345.

Once connected:
✅ The “handshake” happens — both sides are now linked.

💬 Step 4 — Send Hello Message
client_socket.send("Hello from Client!".encode('ascii'))


The client sends a greeting message to the server.

The .encode('ascii') converts the string into bytes (required for sending).

💬 Step 5 — Receive Reply from Server
response = client_socket.recv(1024).decode('ascii')
print("Server says:", response)


The client waits for the server’s reply (like a “Hello” back).

recv(1024) reads up to 1024 bytes.

.decode('ascii') converts bytes to text again.

Example output:

Server says: Hello from Server!

📁 Step 6 — Send File Name
filename = "sample.txt"
client_socket.send(filename.encode('ascii'))  # send filename first


The client first tells the server the name of the file it’s about to send.

This helps the server know what name to use for saving it (e.g., received_sample.txt).

📂 Step 7 — Send File Content
with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    data = f.read(1024)
    while data:
        client_socket.send(data)
        data = f.read(1024)


Opens the file in binary read mode (rb).

Reads the file in 1 KB chunks (1024 bytes) and sends it continuously until the file is finished.

🔚 Step 8 — Close the Connection
client_socket.close()
print(f"File '{filename}' sent successfully.")


Ends the connection and prints a confirmation message.

💻 HOW TO RUN BOTH FILES (step-by-step)
🧩 Folder Setup

Make a folder, e.g.:

C:\TCP_Project


Put both files in it:

C:\TCP_Project\server.py
C:\TCP_Project\client.py
C:\TCP_Project\sample.txt   ← the file you want to send

🪟 Step 1 — Open 2 CMD windows

CMD 1 (Server side):

cd C:\TCP_Project
python server.py


You should see:

Server listening...


CMD 2 (Client side):

cd C:\TCP_Project
python client.py


You should see:

Server says: Hello from Server!
File 'sample.txt' sent successfully.

🧾 Step 2 — Verify Output

Now check your folder again.

You’ll see:

received_sample.txt
