7. Study and Analyze the performance of HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocol using Packet Tracer tool.

🎯 Aim / Objective

To study, configure, and analyze how different application layer protocols — HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP — operate in a network and compare their working, ports, and data transfer security/performance using Cisco Packet Tracer.

📘 Concept / Theory
1️⃣ HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

Port used: 80

Used for: Accessing web pages (insecure)

Works in plain text — no encryption.

Faster but not secure.

Example: http://example.com

2️⃣ HTTPS (HTTP Secure)

Port used: 443

Encrypted version of HTTP (uses SSL/TLS).

Secure communication between client and server.

Slightly slower because of encryption overhead.

Example: https://example.com

3️⃣ FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

Ports used: 21 (control) and 20 (data)

Used for transferring files between client and server.

Can be anonymous or user-password based.

No encryption (FTPS/SFTP are secure variants).

🧱 Network Setup (In Packet Tracer)
📂 Devices Required:
Device	Quantity	Purpose
PCs	3	Clients
Server	1	Acts as Web + FTP Server
Switch	1	Connects all devices
Router (optional)	1	If you want multiple networks
🧰 Configuration Steps (Step-by-Step)
⚙️ Step 1 — Create Topology

Drag and drop:

3 PCs (PC0, PC1, PC2)

1 Server (Server0)

1 Switch (2960)

Connect them using Copper Straight-Through Cables.

⚙️ Step 2 — Assign IP Addresses
Device	IP Address	Subnet Mask	Gateway
Server0	192.168.1.1	255.255.255.0	-
PC0	192.168.1.2	255.255.255.0	-
PC1	192.168.1.3	255.255.255.0	-
PC2	192.168.1.4	255.255.255.0	-
⚙️ Step 3 — Configure Server Services
🖥️ On Server0:

Click Server0 → Services tab.

Turn ON the following services:

HTTP → On

HTTPS → On

FTP → On

For HTTP/HTTPS:

You can edit index.html (sample webpage content).

For FTP:

Add username and password under FTP tab.

Upload files for testing (like file1.txt).

⚙️ Step 4 — Test from Clients
🔹 HTTP Test:

Go to PC0 → Desktop → Web Browser.

Type: http://192.168.1.1

You’ll see the web page served by the server.

🔹 HTTPS Test:

Type: https://192.168.1.1

It will take slightly longer (due to SSL handshake).

You’ll get a secure page connection.

🔹 FTP Test:

Go to PC1 → Desktop → Command Prompt.

Type:

ftp 192.168.1.1


Enter username & password (if any).

Try commands like:

dir
get file1.txt
put file2.txt
bye

#
make file in any pc in notepade and save it
from pc1 1st put file.txt
then do dir we will get lis
then do get file.txt
#
Observe file transfer working.

⚙️ Step 5 — Analyze the Performance

To analyze how each protocol performs:

Go to Simulation Mode in Packet Tracer.

Add capture filters (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP).

Generate traffic:

PC sends request → Server responds.

Observe:

Time delay (latency)

Data size (in simulation panel)

Encryption steps (in HTTPS)

Compare which protocol is faster or slower and why.

📊 Expected Results / Observations
Protocol	Port	Secure	Speed	       Data Encryption	                Use Case
HTTP	        80	❌ No	Fast	            No	                      Browsing non-sensitive websites
HTTPS	        443	✅ Yes	Slightly slower	    Yes (SSL/TLS)	          Secure transactions, login pages
FTP	      20, 21	❌ No	Moderate	     No	                            File upload/download
🧩 Conclusion

HTTP provides faster but unsecured data transfer.

HTTPS ensures confidential and secure transmission using encryption (at the cost of slightly higher processing time).

FTP is efficient for file transfer between client and server, but without encryption it is not secure.

HTTPS is best when data security is critical.
